# UserManage
This is a Qt project for data management in tree structure diagrams. It mainly stores the relevant information of each member under the class of the user list. The code adopts the MVC design architecture and supports adding new user groups or users through a visual interface or via HTTP. Currently, it is still in the improvement stage.
